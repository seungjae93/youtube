        "description": "Gerçekler mutlu etmez. Ancak mutsuzluğun ve hayatın gerçeklerinin harekete geçirici etkisi vardır. Behçet Yalın Özkara eğitimin mutluluk getireceğine inandı. Bu nedenle ESOGÜ İşletmeden lisans ve doktora, Hacettepe’den Yüksek Lisans, Anadolu İktisattan lisans, Dış ticaret ve Halkla ilişkilerden ise önlisans diplomalarını aldı. Ancak elde ettiği mutluluk çok kısa sürdü. Bu sefer, Yurtdışında eğitim görerek mutluluğu yakalayacağına inandı. Seul Hanyang, Massachusetts ve Michigan üniversitelerinde bulundu. Yine olmadı. Ardından şöhret belki beni mutlu eder diye umdu. Akademiklink isimli bir youtube kanalı açtı. Behçet Yalın Özkara believed that education would lead him to happiness. For this reason, he pursued education and received several degrees; bachelor's degree and Phd. in Business at ESOGU, master at Hacettepe, bachelor's degree in Economics and associate degree in Foreign Trade and Public Relations at Anadolu University. However, the happiness he achieved didn't last long. This time, he thought he would find happiness by studying abroad. Then he's been at Hanyang University of Seoul, University of Massachusettes and University of Michigan. Happiness didn't happen again. Then he thought fame might bring him happiness. So he started a Youtube Channel named \"Akademiklink\". He is still unhappy but has full faith that someday he will be happy. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

        "title": "Six behaviors to increase your confidence | Emily Jaenson | TEDxReno",
        "description": "Research tells us that the way to get people to change is not to start with trying to change their attitudes alone, but to start with the behaviors associated with the attitudes. When people see themselves behaving differently, they can then think of themselves differently and the attitude change will follow. The six behaviors discussed that you could start today are derived from over 90 interviews with female executives in sports. \n\nEmily Jaenson’s motto is “Be so good they won’t forget you!” and this motto has carried her through her career to land her former role as General Manager of the Triple-A Reno Aces.  Upon accepting this role in 2018, Jaenson became the first female in Triple-A to hold the GM role in nearly 20 years. Jaenson leads a podcast, Leadership is Female, where she interviews executives in sport so that she and her guests can guide the next generation of female leadership forward and leads a team of sports front office veterans in their consulting business. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

        "description": "There are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world -- and they all have different sounds, vocabularies and structures. But do they shape the way we think? Cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky shares examples of language -- from an Aboriginal community in Australia that uses cardinal directions instead of left and right to the multiple words for blue in Russian -- that suggest the answer is a resounding yes. \"The beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is,\" Boroditsky says. \"Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

        "description": "In a classic research-based TEDx Talk, Dr. Lara Boyd describes how neuroplasticity gives you the power to shape the brain you want. Recorded at TEDxVancouver at Rogers Arena on November 14, 2015.\n\nYouTube Tags: brain science, brain, stroke, neuroplasticity, science, motor learning, identity, TED, TEDxVancouver, TEDxVancouver 2015, Vancouver, TEDx, Rogers Arena, Vancouver speakers, Vancouver conference, ideas worth spreading, great idea,\n\nOur knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. \n\nDr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

        "description": "Never miss a talk! SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nAs the Athletic Director and head coach of the Varsity Soccer team at Ryerson University, Dr. Joseph is often asked what skills he is searching for as a recruiter: is it speed? Strength? Agility? In Dr. Joseph's TEDx Talk, he explores self confidence and how it is not just the most important skill in athletics, but in our lives.\n \nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",
