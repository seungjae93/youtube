        "description": "He’s A Superhero, Whether He Likes It Or Not #BlueBeetle - Only in Theaters August 18\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures comes the feature film “Blue Beetle,” marking the DC Super Hero’s first time on the big screen. The film, directed by Angel Manuel Soto, stars Xolo Maridueña in the title role as well as his alter ego, Jaime Reyes.\nRecent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero BLUE BEETLE.\n\nStarring alongside Maridueña (“Cobra Kai”) are Adriana Barraza (“Rambo: Last Blood,” “Thor”), Damían Alcázar (“Narcos,” “Narcos: Mexico”), Elpidia Carrillo (“Mayans M.C.,” the “Predator” films), Bruna Marquezine (“Maldivas,” “God Save the King”), Raoul Max Trujillo (the “Sicario” films, “Mayans M.C.”), with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (“Monarch,” “Dead Man Walking”), and George Lopez (the “Rio and “Smurf” franchises).

Soto (“Charm City Kings,” “The Farm”) directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss Bala”), based on characters from DC.\n\nJohn Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.\n\nThe director’s creative team behind the scenes includes director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski (“Midsommar,” “Hereditary”), production designer John Billington (“Bad Boys for Life”), editor Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “The Lost City”), Oscar-nominated costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (“Jojo Rabbit,” the “Thor” films), visual effects supervisor Kelvin McIlwain (“The Suicide Squad,” “Aquaman”) and composer Bobby Krlic (“Midsommar,” the “Snowpiercer” series).\nA Warner Bros.

        "title": "This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...",
        "description": "This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.\n\nThis was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.\n\nTwitter: @Dream\nInstagram: @DreamWasTaken\nSnapchat: @Dream\n\nIn this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  \n\nLive voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.\n\nI truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.\n\nIn this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.\n\nThis has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.\n\nWhenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.\n\nI am releasing an SMP, the \"United SMP\", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages.

          "title": "This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...",
          "description": "This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.\n\nThis was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.\n\nTwitter: @Dream\nInstagram: @DreamWasTaken\nSnapchat: @Dream\n\nIn this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  \n\nLive voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.\n\nI truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.\n\nIn this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.\n\nThis has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.\n\nWhenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.\n\nI am releasing an SMP, the \"United SMP\", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages. Most of these people are people I never would have been able to collaborate with, or make jokes with, or share with my fans, so I am so excited to share our community with the world. There will be more details on my twitter about this, and I will be live streaming the server in the future.\n\nthank you guys for watching and supporting the channel to make stuff like this possible."
